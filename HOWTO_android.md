## Purpose

This document shows several examples of how to use the GFXReconstruct tools.
These examples will help work through issues you may discover while attempting
to perform the same process on your own application.

**NOTE:**
Many of these examples are given based on using a Linux system as the build
and/or host, but you should be able to replicate the behavior on a Windows
system with very few changes.

## Building Vulkan Samples with the Capture Layer

Let's look at adding the GFXReconstruct layer as a requirement of the
[Khronos Vulkan Samples](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples)
project.
These steps assume that you have installed all the appropriate dependencies
necessary to build that project.
Please refer to that repository to ensure these dependencies have been
met before continuing.

### 1. Pull down the GFXReconstruct source

If you haven't already, pull down the GFXReconstruct source from GitHub so that
it also updates any necessary submodules as part of the clone operation:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LunarG/gfxreconstruct.git
```

The full location of the `gfxreconstruct` folder generated from this step
is to be used in all cases below for `{gfxreconstruct_root}`.

### 2. Pull down the source for Vulkan Samples

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples.git
```

Alternatively, if this is not the first time the tree is cloned, simply enter
the folder containing the source and update to the latest, but also make sure
that the submodules are re-inited and updated (because additional submodules may
have been added).

```bash
cd Vulkan-Samples
git pull
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
```

### 3. Enter the Vulkan Samples source directory

```bash
cd Vulkan-Samples
```

### 4. Build the necessary Android files

To build/setup the Vulkan-Samples source for Android, follow the instructions in
[the README](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/blob/main/docs/build.adoc#android)
found in that GitHub repo.

Follow these instructions up until the instructions to activate the build using
Gradle, and then stop until GFXReconstruct has been enabled.

In a nutshell, the following command should be executed to generate the
necessary files, but it has been known to change:

#### Current Vulkan-Samples Android generation

On a clean tree, the first step is to generate the necessary Android files:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate.py android
```

#### Previous Vulkan-Samples Android generation

On some older versions of `Vulkan-Samples` the Android files were
generated using a different script:

```bash
./bldsys/scripts/generate_android_gradle.sh
```

### 5. Edit the top-level settings.gradle file
   (./build/android_gradle/settings.gradle)
   and add the following lines to the end

```text
include(':app',':VkLayer_gfxreconstruct')
project(':VkLayer_gfxreconstruct').projectDir = file('{gfxreconstruct_root}/android/layer')
```

**NOTE**: Replace {gfxreconstruct_root} with the full path location of the
source you cloned from the GFXReconstruct repo in Step 1.

### 6. Add the capture layer to the samples application

Open ./build/android_gradle/app/build.gradle and add the following line at the
top of the `dependencies` block at the end of the file:

```text
    implementation project(':VkLayer_gfxreconstruct')
```

It should look something like this when you are done:

```text
dependencies {
    implementation project(':VkLayer_gfxreconstruct')
	implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.0'
	implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.4.0'
	implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.0.4'
}
```

### 7. Change to the appropriate build folder

From the top-level samples folder you now need to enter the following sub-
folder to build

```bash
cd build/android_gradle
```

### 8. Build the appropriate target

Some common targets are `assembleDebug` and `assembleRelease`.
We'll build for debug in this scenario:

```bash
gradle assembleDebug
```


## Capturing Vulkan Samples

The example that follows uses the Khronos Vulkan Samples built above and assumes
that you built the debug version.
The benefit of building the application in this way is that it will
automatically incorporate the GFXReconstruct capture layer into the .APK file
for the built application.

### 1. Run Logcat

```bash
adb logcat -s gfxrecon,vulkan
```

### 2. Install the debug version with storage access

Install the debug version of the samples we just built with the
`-g` option to request storage access:

```bash
adb install -g ./build/android_gradle/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/vulkan_samples-debug.apk
```

This should guarantee that the application (and any associated layers) can
output anything generated.

### 3. Enable GFXReconstruct

Enable the GFXReconstruct layer only for the application using the global
settings Android provides:

```bash
adb shell settings put global enable_gpu_debug_layers 1
adb shell settings put global gpu_debug_app com.khronos.vulkan_samples
adb shell settings put global gpu_debug_layers "VK_LAYER_LUNARG_gfxreconstruct"
```

### 4. Set the capture options

Now, set the command to capture frames 500-700 so we can see what's happening
and write the file to the `/sdcard/Download` folder:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.capture_file  '/sdcard/Download/samples_capture.gfxr'"
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.capture_frames '500-700'"
```

More capture options can be found in the [USAGE_android.md](./USAGE_android.md)
under the [Capture Options](./USAGE_android.md#capture-options) section.

### 5. Run the application

Keep the logcat output in a separate window/terminal so you can monitor it for
any useful information.

To run the application, look at the application list on the Android device,
then click the `Vulkan Samples` application to launch.
Android may ask you to "Allow access to manage all files."
When asked, enable the option and click the back arrow to get to the
application.

Once launched, you will see something similar to the following in the `logcat`
window/terminal:

```text
D vulkan  : added global layer 'VK_LAYER_LUNARG_gfxreconstruct' from library '/data/app/~~3mMLAga5cfTsFt19iAcISQ==/com.khronos.vulkan_samples-cwdD6xdzmqmyo6QTZDsjng==/base.apk!/lib/arm64-v8a/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so'
```

This message states that it found the GFXReconstruct capture layer in the
base.apk file which we built earlier -- meaning there's no need to add an
additional external layer to any folders.

Now, click on one of the samples.
In this scenario, let's click on the "Dynamic uniform buffers" test.

Logcat should show:

```text
gfxrecon: Finished recording graphics API capture
```

Exit the application.

**NOTE:**
If the application rendered correctly, proceed to Step  6.
If the application rendered incorrectly during the capture, review the guidance
below.

Running certain Vulkan samples tests results in corruption and requires
additional changes to capture properly.
For example, if you attempted to capture the "Instancing" sample, it will render
without the asteroids.
This is because the GFXReconstruct layer needs some additional settings to
properly align and track the memory.

First, we will enable page guard on the memory:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_persistent_memory true"
```

When this option is enabled, an allocation with a size equal to that of the
object being mapped is made once on the first map and is not freed until the
object is destroyed.
Use this option with applications that frequently map and unmap large memory
ranges -- avoiding frequent allocation and copy operations that can have a
negative impact on performance.

Next, we will force page guard buffer sizes to be aligned to page size:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_align_buffer_sizes true"
```

This option overrides the Vulkan API calls that report buffer memory properties
to report that buffer sizes and alignments must be a multiple of the system page
size.
Use this option with applications that perform CPU writes and GPU writes/copies
to different buffers that are bound to the same page of mapped memory, which may
result in data being lost when copying pages from the `page_guard` shadow
allocation to the real allocation.
This data loss can result in visible corruption during capture.
Forcing buffer sizes and alignments to a multiple of the system page size
prevents multiple buffers from being bound to the same page, avoiding data loss
from simultaneous CPU writes to the shadow allocation and GPU writes to the real
allocation for different buffers bound to the same page.

After making these changes, re-open the application and re-attempt recapture.


### 6. Verify the Capture File

With `adb logcat` open, look at the output to determine the location to which
the file was recorded.
In my case, the file was recorded to `/sdcard/Download`.
**NOTE**: It actually lists the full file in the message like the following:

```text
gfxrecon: Recording graphics API capture to /sdcard/Download/gfxrecon_capture_frames_500_through_700_20221211T130328.gfxr
```

But, let's say you didn't know, so double check that folder:

```bash
adb shell ls /sdcard/Download
```

The output might look like this:

```text
gfxrecon_capture_frames_500_through_700_20221211T130328.gfxr
```

There's our file right there.

### 7. Disable The GFXReconstruct layer

We want to make sure that the layer is not present for any further work we
are going to do.
In this case, we're going to check our replay, so disable any active debug
layers so they don't interfere with the tool.

```bash
adb shell settings put global enable_gpu_debug_layers 0
adb shell "settings put global gpu_debug_layers ''"
```

### 8. Install the replay application

Now, we need to install the Replay application that we built as part of the
GFXReconstruct source.
From the top of the source pulled down from the repo by using the
`gfxrecon.py` script:

```bash
./android/scripts/gfxrecon.py install-apk android/tools/replay/build/outputs/apk/debug/replay-debug.apk
```

#### Additional Permissions

A recent change to enable the replay tool on Android 12 and greater has resulted
in the need of enabling additional permissions on some versions of Android.
This was the result of updating the replay's Android Manifest file to add the
`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission flag.

##### Android 10

For replay devices running Android 10, the replay tool now requires the enabling
of legacy storage access:

```bash
adb shell appops set com.lunarg.gfxreconstruct.replay android:legacy_storage allow
```

##### Android 11 and Newer

For replay devices running Android 11 and newer, the replay tool requires that
the Android permission for `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` be granted either through
the following `adb` command or by clicking on the permission dialog when it
opens up:

```bash
adb shell appops set com.lunarg.gfxreconstruct.replay MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE allow
```

### 9. Run the replay

Try running the replay using the `gfxrecon.py` script:

```bash
./android/scripts/gfxrecon.py replay /sdcard/Download/gfxrecon_capture_frames_500_through_700_20221211T130328.gfxr
```

Voila!
It worked, the replay executes properly.

### 10. Pull down the replay if needed

If you need to share your replay file, make sure to pull it off of the
device for sharing:

```bash
adb pull /sdcard/Download/gfxrecon_capture_frames_500_through_700_20221211T130328.gfxr
```

## Capturing Released Application On Rooted System

In this example, we'll capture a set of frames from the GPUScore benchmark.
This set of instructions assume that you have already properly rooted your
device, reinstalled the correct Android image, and installed the target
application (in this case the benchmark).

### 1. Create an ADB shell with admin capabilities

```bash
adb shell
su
```

We'll refer to this as the admin ADB shell from here on out.

### 2. Find out full name of application

In another terminal/command window, run `logcat` to see application messages:

```bash
adb logcat -s vulkan
```

Then run the application and watch for the message with the full name.

In my case, I see that the full application name is
`com.basemark.gpuscore.sacredpath`.

Alternatively, you can browse the list of installed applications:

```bash
adb shell cmd package list packages -3
```

### 3. Find out path for data

In the admin adb shell, run the following:

```bash
find /data/app -name *${Full Application Name}*
```

Where `${Full Application Name}` is the name we discovered in step 2 above.

On my system, running `find /data/app -name *com.basemark.gpuscore.sacredpath*`
returned:

```text
/data/app/~~CklMw7KUY3NvpJa1VxdzCg==/com.basemark.gpuscore.sacredpath-y4DeeR7lnUlvifTr1xSRWA==
```

### 4. Copy over the GFXReconstruct capture layer

In another terminal/command window, change directory to the location of your
GFXReconstruct source.
After building, perform the following command:

```bash
adb push \
    ./android/layer/build/intermediates/cmake/debug/obj/arm64-v8a/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so \
    /storage/emulated/0/Download
```

Now, copy it into the application folder discovered in step 3 above using the
admin ADB shell:

```bash
mv /storage/emulated/0/Download/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so \ 
       ${Application Data Path}/lib/arm64/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so
```

Again, my full command was:

```bash
mv /storage/emulated/0/Download/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so \ 
      /data/app/~~CklMw7KUY3NvpJa1VxdzCg==/com.basemark.gpuscore.sacredpath-y4DeeR7lnUlvifTr1xSRWA==/lib/arm64/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so
```

Finally, make the capture layer executable:

```bash
chmod 777 /data/app/~~CklMw7KUY3NvpJa1VxdzCg==/com.basemark.gpuscore.sacredpath-y4DeeR7lnUlvifTr1xSRWA==/lib/arm64/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so
```

### 5. Enable the layer for capture

Several differences versus the non-rooted path include:
 * You must enable the layer system wide in this configuration
 * You need to disable the Vulkan usage for the UI or it would interfere with
   the capture:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.vulkan.layers 'VK_LAYER_LUNARG_gfxreconstruct'"
adb shell "setprop debug.hwui.renderer 'skiagl'"
```

### 6. Set GFXReconstruct capture options

Now, set the command to capture frames 100-200 so we can see what's happening:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.capture_frames '100-200'"
```

And set the output filename to the proper location:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.capture_file /storage/emulated/0/Download/sacredpath_capture.gfxr"
```

We will enable page guard on the memory:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_persistent_memory true"
```

When this option is enabled, an allocation with a size equal to that of the
object being mapped is made once on the first map and is not freed until the
object is destroyed.
This option is intended to be used with applications that frequently map and
unmap large memory ranges, to avoid frequent allocation and copy operations that
can have a negative impact on performance.

Next, we will force page guard buffers are aligned to pages:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_align_buffer_sizes true"
```

This option overrides the Vulkan API calls that report buffer memory properties
to report that buffer sizes and alignments must be a multiple of the system page
size.
This option is intended to be used with applications that perform CPU writes and
GPU writes/copies to different buffers that are bound to the same page of mapped
memory, which may result in data being lost when copying pages from the
`page_guard` shadow allocation to the real allocation.
This data loss can result in visible corruption during capture.
Forcing buffer sizes and alignments to a multiple of the system page size
prevents multiple buffers from being bound to the same page, avoiding data loss
from simultaneous CPU writes to the shadow allocation and GPU writes to the real
allocation for different buffers bound to the same page.

More capture options can be found in the [USAGE_android.md](./USAGE_android.md)
under the [Capture Options](./USAGE_android.md#capture-options) section.

### 7. Give the application permission to write

```bash
adb shell pm grant com.basemark.gpuscore.sacredpath android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
```

### 8. Run the application

In my case, I opened up the menu, found the GPUScore application and chose
the official "Sacred Path" benchmark.

Watching the log output in the above `adb logcat` terminal, I waited until
the benchmark completed and then exited the application.

I made sure that I saw the following to make sure the recording started:

```text
I gfxrecon: Recording graphics API capture to /storage/emulated/0/Download/sacredpath_capture_frames_100_through_200_20221215T174939.gfxr
```

### 9. Verify the capture file

Check that the above file exists:

```bash
adb shell ls /storage/emulated/0/Download/sacredpath_capture_frames*.gfxr
```

### 10. Disable the capture layer

Disable the capture layer globally and also restore the Vulkan usage of the
HWUI:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.vulkan.layers ''"
adb shell "setprop debug.hwui.renderer 'skiavk'"
```

### 11. Install the replay application

Now, we need to install the Replay application that we built as part of the
GFXReconstruct source.
Install the replay APK from the root of the built source tree by using the
`gfxrecon.py` script:

```bash
./android/scripts/gfxrecon.py install-apk android/tools/replay/build/outputs/apk/debug/replay-debug.apk
```

### 12. Run the replay

Try running the replay using the `gfxrecon.py` script:

```bash
./android/scripts/gfxrecon.py replay /storage/emulated/0/Download/sacredpath_capture_frames_100_through_200_20221215T174939.gfxr
```

**NOTE:** Please refer to [Additional Permissions](#additional-permissions)
above for additional permissions that may need to be enabled to run the
replay application on certain versions of Android.
