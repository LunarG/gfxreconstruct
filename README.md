# EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH!!!

** WARNING!! **

This is an experimental branch working to add OpenXR support to GFXReconstruct.
The OpenXR capture API layer is not yet implemented and is still in progress.

Use this branch at your own risk!

** WARNING!! **

# Project Components

The GFXReconstruct project provides tools for the capture and replay of graphics 
API calls, allowing the graphics commands executed by an application
to be recorded to a file that may later be replayed to reconstruct the
graphics-specific behavior of the captured application. The replay code has
been organized with a framework design to make it easy to create additional
tools for processing capture files. 

The GFXReconstruct components currently provided with this repository are:

* The `VK_LAYER_LUNARG_gfxreconstruct` Vulkan layer for capturing
   Vulkan application commands.
* The D3D12 capture libraries for capturing D3D12 application commands.
* The `gfxrecon-replay` tool to replay GFXReconstruct capture files.
* The `gfxrecon-info` tool to print information describing GFXReconstruct
  capture files.
* The `gfxrecon-compress` tool to compress/decompress GFXReconstruct
  capture files.
  * **NOTE:** The gfxrecon-compress tool requires LZ4, Zstandard, and/or
    zlib, which are currently optional build dependencies.
* The `gfxrecon-extract` tool to extract SPIR-V binaries from
  GFXReconstruct capture files.
* The `gfxrecon-convert` tool to convert GFXReconstruct capture files to
  a [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) listing of API calls. (experimental
  for D3D12 captures)
* The `gfxrecon-optimize` tool to produce new capture files with 
  improved replay performance.
