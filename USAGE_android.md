## Behavior on Android

The purpose of this section is to describe some of the software changes made to
the GFXReconstruct software to add Android support.
This section will not provide a comprehensive list of changes, but will instead
highlight some of the primary adjustments required to adapt the GFXReconstruct
software to the Android ecosystem.

### Android Writable Locations

The contents of the traces should be written to external storage on the
Android device.
The final "external storage" result varies based on Android version but some
locations that can be tried are:

 - `/sdcard/Download`
 - `/storage/emulated/0/Download`
 - `/sdcard/Android/data/${Application Full Name}`
 - `/sdcard`
 - `/mnt/shell/emulated/0`

Where `${Application Full Name}` is the full name of the application, such
as `com.khronos.vulkand_samples`.

Some devices won't allow access to those folders for certain applications.
In those cases, the following folders can be used, but will require `adb` root
access to retrieve the files:

 - `/data/data/${Application Full Name}/`
 - `/data/user/0/${Application Full Name}/`

**NOTE:** These directories may not be visible to other applications (including
gfxrecon-replay, adb pull), so any capture files will need to be copied to a
readable location with adb shell before they can be replayed.

## Capturing API Calls

The GFXReconstruct capture layer is a Vulkan layer that intercepts Vulkan API
calls and logs them to a GFXReconstruct capture file.

### Before Use

#### Permissions

The GFXReconstruct layer can optionally read a configuration file
from or write capture files to external storage.  This requires that
the application loading the layer have external storage permissions.

The read and write external storage permission may be requested in
the application's manifest file.  When installing the application,
it may be necessary to ensure that the requested permissions are
granted through one of the following actions:

When installing the application with `adb install`:

* Specify the -g option: `adb install -g`

When deploying from Android Studio:

* Click on "Run" in the menu
* Choose "Edit Configurations..."
* In the dialog box, look for the "Install Flags:" text box
* Enter `-g`
* Click "Apply"

It may also be possible to grant external storage permissions to
an installed application through the device Settings.

**Failure to enable the write external storage permission** can cause
the layer to return `VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` from its
`vkCreateInstance` function if it fails to create a capture file.

#### Understanding GFXReconstruct Layer Memory Capture

The Vulkan API allows Vulkan memory objects to be mapped by an application
for direct modification.
To successfully capture an application, the GFXReconstruct layer must be able to
detect when the application modifies the mapped memory.

The layer can be configured to detect memory modifications by marking the mapped
memory as write protected, triggering an access violation when the application
writes to the memory.
The layer then uses a signal handler to intercept the signal generated by the
access violation, where it removes the write protection, marks the modified
memory page as dirty, and allows the application to continue.

##### Disabling Debug Breaks Triggered by the GFXReconstruct Layer

When running an application in a debugger with the layer enabled, the
access violations triggered by the layer's memory tracking behavior may
cause the debugger to break. These debug breaks may be disabled for LLDB with
the following command:

```text
process handle SIGSEGV -n true -p true -s false
```

This command may be entered manually through the LLDB tab on Android Studio's
Debug panel.

It may also be set as a post attach command in the project configuration:

* Click on "Run" in the menu
* Choose "Edit Configurations..."
* In the dialog box, select the "Debugger" tab
* In the "Debugger" tab, select the "LLDB Post Attach Commands" tab
* Click the `+` to add the command to the command list
* Enter the `process handle SIGSEGV -n true -p true -s false` command
* Click "Apply"


### To Root Or Not To Root

Rooting the Android device for capture is not required if you are attempting
to capture an application that is built in Debug mode.
This is especially true if you can build in Debug mode and associate it with the
GFXReconstruct layer during the build.

One of the ways to set the application to debug requires modifying the
application Manifest file and setting the `android:debuggable` flag to true
before rebuilding.
Refer to the following info:
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#debug

Alternatively, if you are building using Gradle, then make sure that the
application's `build.gradle` contains the `debuggable` flag under the
appropriate "buildTypes" section:

```text
debug {
   debuggable true
}
```

However, if you can not do that, your only option is to attempt to capture
the image on a rooted device.
Instructions for rooting Android devices are available on the internet.

If not building the application with the layer, several additional steps are
required once the application is installed on a rooted Android device:

#### Start ADB Shell With Admin Privileges

```bash
adb shell
su
```

#### Locate the Application Data Directory

```bash
find /data/app -name *${Application Full Name}*
```

**NOTE:** Replace `${Application Full Name}` with the full Android name of the
application being captured, for example "com.khronos.vulkan_samples" is the full
name of the Vulkan Samples.
You can find out the application full name by watch Logcat output if you don't
already know it.

#### Find the Appropriate Capture Layer .so

By default, the capture layer's shared object file will be written to:

```bash
./android/layer/build/intermediates/cmake/${Build Type}/obj/${Build Target}/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so
```

`${Build Type}` is the build type used when compiling the layer: "debug" or
"release".

`${Build Target}` is the platform target: "arm64-v8a", "armeabi-v7a", etc.

#### Copy the Capture Layer Onto the Device

The data folder returned by the instructions in
[Locate the Application Data Directory](#locate-the-application-data-directory)
above can be used to store the layer, but it must be placed in the appropriate
library path.
However, you can't copy it directly, so you need to first push the file into
either the `/sdcard/Download` or `/storage/emulated/0/Download` directory with an adb
command:

```bash
adb push \
    ./android/layer/build/intermediates/cmake/${Build Type}/obj/${Build Target}/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so \
    /sdcard/Download
```

For example, for a debug build of the ARM64 version of the library:

```bash
adb push \
    ./android/layer/build/intermediates/cmake/debug/obj/arm64-v8a/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so \
    /sdcard/Download
```

Then move it to the application folder using the adb shell with Admin authority:

```bash
mv /sdcard/Download/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so \
       ${Application Data Path}/lib/arm64/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so
```

Make the layer copied over above writeable on the system using the ADB
Admin shell:

```bash
chmod 777 ${Application Data Path}/lib/arm64/libVkLayer_gfxreconstruct.so
```

#### Give Application Write Permissions
You may also have to give the application permission to write to external
storage using:

```bash
adb shell pm grant ${Application Full Name} android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
```

### Enabling the Layer with ADB

#### Enable the Layer a Specific Application

To enable the GFXReconstruct capture layer just for a specific application
requires that 4 steps be taken:

 1. Make sure the application is debuggable
 2. Enable GPU Debug layers
 3. Indicate what app you are enabling GPU Debug on
 4. Identify the layers used to debug (in this case the layer is
    `VK_LAYER_LUNARG_gfxreconstruct`)

Together, the last 3 commands look like the following.

```bash
adb shell settings put global enable_gpu_debug_layers 1
adb shell settings put global gpu_debug_app ${Application Full Name}
adb shell settings put global gpu_debug_layers VK_LAYER_LUNARG_gfxreconstruct
```

**NOTE:** Replace `${Application Full Name}` with the full Android name of the
application being captured, for example "com.khronos.vulkan_samples" is the full
name of the Vulkan Samples.

If you attempt to capture and nothing is happening, check the `logcat` output.
A successful run of GFXReconstruct should show a message like the following:

```text
I gfxrecon: Initializing GFXReconstruct capture layer
```

If that fails to show up, you may have to try enabling the layer for the entire
system.

#### Enable the Layer for the Entire System

The layer can be enabled through a system property by executing the following
ADB command:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.vulkan.layers 'VK_LAYER_LUNARG_gfxreconstruct'"
```

The following command will disable the layer:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.vulkan.layers ''"
```

**NOTE:** The downside to this alternative is that some Android systems use
Vulkan to render the UI.
In this scenario, enabling the layer may cause the desktop UI to either be
recorded as well, or possibly become unresponsive.
If this occurs, the UI can be forced to run in OpenGL mode on most Android
devices using:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.hwui.renderer 'skiagl'"
```

### Capture Options

The GFXReconstruct layer supports the following options, which may be enabled
through Android system properties or a layer settings file.  Each Android
system property begins with the prefix `debug.gfxrecon`, and can be set
through ADB with the following command syntax:

```bash
adb shell "setprop <option> '<value>'"
```

For example, to set the log_level to "warning", specify:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.log_level 'warning'"
```

#### Supported Options

Options with the BOOL type accept the following values:

* A case-insensitive string value 'true' or a non-zero integer value indicate true.
* A case-insensitive string value 'false' or a zero integer value indicate false.

The capture layer will generate a warning message for unrecognized or invalid
option values.

Option | Property | Type | Description
------| ------------- |------|-------------
Capture File Name | debug.gfxrecon.capture_file | STRING | Path to use when creating the capture file.  Default is: `/sdcard/gfxrecon_capture.gfxr`
Capture Specific Frames | debug.gfxrecon.capture_frames | STRING | Specify one or more comma-separated frame ranges to capture.  Each range will be written to its own file.  A frame range can be specified as a single value, to specify a single frame to capture, or as two hyphenated values, to specify the first and last frame to capture.  Frame ranges should be specified in ascending order and cannot overlap. Note that frame numbering is 1-based (i.e. the first frame is frame 1).  Example: `200,301-305` will create two capture files, one containing a single frame and one containing five frames.  Default is: Empty string (all frames are captured).
Capture trigger for Android | debug.gfxrecon.capture_android_trigger | BOOL | Set during runtime to `true` to start capturing and to `false` to stop. If not set at all then it is disabled (non-trimmed capture). Default is not set.
Capture File Compression Type | debug.gfxrecon.capture_compression_type | STRING | Compression format to use with the capture file.  Valid values are: `LZ4`, `ZLIB`, `ZSTD`, and `NONE`. Default is: `LZ4`
Capture File Timestamp | debug.gfxrecon.capture_file_timestamp | BOOL | Add a timestamp to the capture file as described by [Timestamps](#timestamps).  Default is: `true`
Capture File Flush After Write | debug.gfxrecon.capture_file_flush | BOOL | Flush output stream after each packet is written to the capture file.  Default is: `false`
Log Level | debug.gfxrecon.log_level | STRING | Specify the highest level message to log.  Options are: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `fatal`.  The specified level and all levels listed after it will be enabled for logging.  For example, choosing the `warning` level will also enable the `error` and `fatal` levels. Default is: `info`
Log Output to Console | debug.gfxrecon.log_output_to_console | BOOL | Log messages will be written to Logcat. Default is: `true`
Log File | debug.gfxrecon.log_file | STRING | When set, log messages will be written to a file at the specified path. Default is: Empty string (file logging disabled).
Log Detailed | debug.gfxrecon.log_detailed | BOOL | Include name and line number from the file responsible for the log message. Default is: `false`
Log Allow Indents | debug.gfxrecon.log_allow_indents | BOOL | Apply additional indentation formatting to log messages. Default is: `false`
Log Break on Error | debug.gfxrecon.log_break_on_error | BOOL | Trigger a debug break when logging an error. Default is: `false`
Log File Create New | debug.gfxrecon.log_file_create_new | BOOL | Specifies that log file initialization should overwrite an existing file when true, or append to an existing file when false. Default is: `true`
Log File Flush After Write | debug.gfxrecon.log_file_flush_after_write | BOOL | Flush the log file to disk after each write when true. Default is: `false`
Log File Keep Open | debug.gfxrecon.log_file_keep_open | BOOL | Keep the log file open between log messages when true, or close and reopen the log file for each message when false. Default is: `true`
Memory Tracking Mode | debug.gfxrecon.memory_tracking_mode | STRING | Specifies the memory tracking mode to use for detecting modifications to mapped Vulkan memory objects. Available options are: `page_guard`, `assisted`, and `unassisted`. Default is `page_guard` <ul><li>`page_guard` tracks modifications to individual memory pages, which are written to the capture file on calls to `vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges`, `vkUnmapMemory`, and `vkQueueSubmit`. Tracking modifications requires allocating shadow memory for all mapped memory and that the `SIGSEGV` signal is enabled in the thread's signal mask.</li><li>`assisted` expects the application to call `vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges` after memory is modified; the memory ranges specified to the `vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges` call will be written to the capture file during the call.</li><li>`unassisted` writes the full content of mapped memory to the capture file on calls to `vkUnmapMemory` and `vkQueueSubmit`. It is very inefficient and may be unusable with real-world applications that map large amounts of memory.</li></ul>
Page Guard Copy on Map | debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_copy_on_map | BOOL | When the `page_guard` memory tracking mode is enabled, copies the content of the mapped memory to the shadow memory immediately after the memory is mapped. Default is: `true`
Page Guard Separate Read Tracking | debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_separate_read | BOOL | When the `page_guard` memory tracking mode is enabled, copies the content of pages accessed for read from mapped memory to shadow memory on each read. Can overwrite unprocessed shadow memory content when an application is reading from and writing to the same page. Default is: `true`
Page Guard Persistent Memory | debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_persistent_memory | BOOL | When the `page_guard` memory tracking mode is enabled, this option changes the way that the shadow memory used to detect modifications to mapped memory is allocated. The default behavior is to allocate and copy the mapped memory range on map and free the allocation on unmap. When this option is enabled, an allocation with a size equal to that of the object being mapped is made once on the first map and is not freed until the object is destroyed.  This option is intended to be used with applications that frequently map and unmap large memory ranges, to avoid frequent allocation and copy operations that can have a negative impact on performance.  This option is ignored when GFXRECON_PAGE_GUARD_EXTERNAL_MEMORY is enabled. Default is `false`
Page Guard Align Buffer Sizes | debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_align_buffer_sizes | BOOL | When the `page_guard` memory tracking mode is enabled, this option overrides the Vulkan API calls that report buffer memory properties to report that buffer sizes and alignments must be a multiple of the system page size.  This option is intended to be used with applications that perform CPU writes and GPU writes/copies to different buffers that are bound to the same page of mapped memory, which may result in data being lost when copying pages from the `page_guard` shadow allocation to the real allocation.  This data loss can result in visible corruption during capture.  Forcing buffer sizes and alignments to a multiple of the system page size prevents multiple buffers from being bound to the same page, avoiding data loss from simultaneous CPU writes to the shadow allocation and GPU writes to the real allocation for different buffers bound to the same page.  This option is only available for the Vulkan API.  Default is `false`
Omit calls with NULL AHardwareBuffer* | debug.gfxrecon.omit_null_hardware_buffers | BOOL | Some GFXReconstruct capture files may replay with a NULL AHardwareBuffer* parameter, for example, vkGetAndroidHardwareBufferPropertiesANDROID.  Although this is invalid Vulkan usage, some drivers may ignore these calls and some may not. This option causes replay to omit Vulkan calls for which the AHardwareBuffer* would be NULL. Default is `false`
Page guard unblock SIGSEGV | debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_unblock_sigsegv | BOOL | When the `page_guard` memory tracking mode is enabled and in the case that SIGSEGV has been marked as blocked in thread's signal mask, setting this enviroment variable to `true` will forcibly re-enable the signal in the thread's signal mask. Default is `false`
Page guard signal handler watcher | debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_signal_handler_watcher | BOOL | When the `page_guard` memory tracking mode is enabled, setting this enviroment variable to `true` will spawn a thread which will periodically reinstall the `SIGSEGV` handler if it has been replaced by the application being traced. Default is `false`
Page guard signal handler watcher max restores | debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_signal_handler_watcher_max_restores | INTEGER | Sets the number of times the watcher will attempt to restore the signal handler. Setting it to a negative value will make the watcher thread run indefinitely. Default is `1`

#### Settings File

Capture options may also be specified through a layer settings file.  The layer
settings file will be loaded before the Android system properties are
processed, allowing system properties to override individual settings file
entries.

The `debug.gfxrecon.settings_path` Android system property is used to enable
a settings file:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.settings_path /sdcard/vk_layer_settings.txt"
```

The system property may be set as either the path to the folder containing a
file named `vk_layer_settings.txt` or the full path to a file with a custom
name. When set to a folder, the capture layer will try to open a file in that
folder named `vk_layer_settings.txt`.  When set to a file, the capture layer
will try to open a file with the specified name.

The settings file may be combined with settings files for other layers. The
capture layer will ignore entries that do not start with the
'lunarg_gfxreconstruct.' prefix.

A sample layer settings file, documenting each available setting, can be found
in the GFXReconstruct GitHub repository at `layer/vk_layer_settings.txt`. Most
binary distributions of the GFXReconstruct software will also include a sample
settings file.

#### Selecting Settings for the page_guard Memory Tracking Mode

The default settings selected for the `page_guard` memory tracking mode are the
settings that are most likely to work on a given platform, but may not provide
the best performance for all cases.

If capture performs poorly with the the default settings, try setting
`debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_persistent_memory` to `true`.

If corruption is observed during capture, try setting
`debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_align_buffer_sizes` to `true`.
If this does not help, try setting `debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_separate_read` to
`false`.

### Capture Files

Capture files are created on the first call to `vkCreateInstance`, when the
Vulkan loader loads the capture layer, and are closed on `vkDestroyInstance`,
when the last active instance is destroyed and the layer is unloaded.

If multiple instances are active concurrently, only one capture file will be
created. If multiple instances are active consecutively (i.e. an instance is
created and destroyed before the next instance is created), the creation of
each instance will generate a new file. For applications that create multiple
instances consecutively, it will be necessary to enable capture file timestamps
to prevent each new instance from overwriting the file created by the previous
instance.

If the layer fails to open the capture file, it will make the call to
`vkCreateInstance` fail, returning `VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED`.

#### Specifying Capture File Location

The capture file's save location can be specified by setting the
`debug.gfxrecon.capture_file` system property, described above in
the [Layer Options](#layer-options) section.

Please note that only some directories are writable.
See [Android Writable Locations](#android-writable-locations) for more info.


#### Timestamps

When capture file timestamps are enabled, a timestamp with an
[ISO 8601-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
format will be added to the name of every file created by the layer. The
timestamp is generated when the capture file is created by the layer's
`vkCreateInstance` function and is added to the base filename specified
through the `debug.gfxrecon.capture_file` system property. Timestamps have
the form:

```text
_yyyymmddThhmmss
```

where the lower-case letters stand for: Year, Month, Day, Hours, Minutes,
Seconds.  The `T` is a designator that separates the date and time components.
Time is reported for the local timezone and is specified with the 24-hour
format.

The following example shows a timestamp that was added to a file that was
originally named `gfxrecon_capture.gfxr` and was created at 2:35 PM
on November 25, 2018:
  `gfxrecon_capture_20181125T143527.gfxr`


#### Retrieving a Trace

First check the directory to make sure a trace exists:

```bash
adb shell ls ${location}
```

For example:

```bash
adb shell ls /sdcard/Download
```

If the trace exists there, for example as "gfxrecon_trace.gfxr", it can be
retrieved from the Android device using the `adb pull` command:

```bash
adb pull ${location}/${filename}
```

Such as:

```bash
adb pull /sdcard/Download/gfxrecon_trace.gfxr
```

This will download the file to the current directory.

### Capture Limitations

#### Conflicts With Crash Detection Libraries

As described in
[Understanding GFXReconstruct Layer Memory Capture](#understanding-gfxreconstruct-layer-memory-capture),
the capture layer uses a signal handler to detect modifications to
mapped memory.
Only one signal handler for that signal can be registered at a time, which can
lead to a potential conflict with crash detection libraries that will also
register a signal handler.

Conflict between the capture layer and crash detection libraries depends on the
order with which each component registers its signal handler.
The capture layer will not register its signal handler until the first call to
`vkMapMemory`.
As long as the application initializes the crash detection library before
calling `vkMapMemory`, there should be no conflict.

The conflict occurs when the application initializes its Vulkan component and
its crash detection library concurrently.
Applications have been observed to initialize Vulkan and begin uploading
resources with one or more threads, while at the same time initializing a crash
detection library from another thread.
For this scenario, the crash detection library sets its signal handler after the
first call to `vkMapMemory`, while a resource upload thread is actively writing
to the mapped memory.
After the crash detection library sets its signal handler, it immediately
receives a SIGSEGV event generated by the concurrent write to mapped memory,
which it detects as a crash and terminates the application.


#### Memory Tracking Limitations

There is a limitation with the page guard memory tracking method used by the
GFXReconstruct capture layer.
The logic behind that method is to apply a memory protection to the
guarded/shadowed regions so that accesses made by the user to trigger a
segmentation fault which is handled by GFXReconstruct.
If the access is made by a system call (like `fread()`) then there won't be a
segmentation fault generated and the function will fail.
As a result the mapped region will not be updated.

#### Android-Specific Limitations

The current version of the Android capture layer has the following limitations:

 * The capture layer must be deployed and enabled manually.
   Future work may provide a tool to automate the process of launching a
   debuggable app, injecting the trace layer with the Java Debug Wire Protocol
   (JDWP), and enabling the layer.
 * Writing files to external storage requires the external storage permission.
   If the app to be captured does not already have this permission, it can be
   granted manually through the Applications panel from device Settings or
   granted through `adb` using the `pm` command as listed later.
 * Adding a timestamp to the filename does not guarantee a unique filename.
   Some applications will query for Vulkan support by creating an instance,
   retrieving instance properties, and then destroying the instance.
   After the initial support query, the application will create a second
   instance to do its real work.
   Each of these Vulkan sessions will generate a capture file.
   If the time elapsed between these two sessions is less than a second, both
   sessions will use the same file name, with the second session overwriting the
   file produced by the first session.

### Troubleshooting Capturing of Applications

There are several steps to take to determine why a capture may not be working.
Attempt each of these and re-run after the suggested modifications to see if
the problem is resolved.

#### Enable LogCat

First, run logcat showing only messages for GFXReconstruct:

```bash
adb logcat -s gfxrecon
```

This should report messages that may be useful in determining the source of the
capture error.

An extended option would be to look for both `gfxrecon` and `vulkan` messages
using this command:

```bash
adb logcat -s gfxrecon,vulkan
```

#### Stop Your App Before Capture

Sometimes, the application could still be running in the background prior to
enabling the capture layer.
In this case, you must force stop the application and restart it in order for
the capture to work properly.

```bash
adb shell am force-stop ${Application Full Name}
```

**NOTE:** Replace `${Application Full Name}` with the full Android name of the
application being captured, for example "com.khronos.vulkan_samples" is the full
name of the Vulkan Samples.

##### Forcing Aligned Pages

In some cases, the application may write to buffers that are bound in the same
mapped page of memory resulting in data being lost when copying pages from the
page_guard shadow allocation to the real allocation.
This data loss can result in visible corruption during capture.

To avoid this issue when using `page_guard`, enable page aligned memory:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_align_buffer_sizes 'true'"
```

##### Application Write Access Issues

`debug.gfxrecon.capture_file` is the most important as the capture layer will
fail if the location isn’t writable by the target app.

See locations list in [Android Writable Locations](#android-writable-locations)
above for ideas of where to store your capture file.

If logcat output shows a line like the following:

```text
E gfxrecon: fopen(/storage/emulated/0/Download/gfxrecon_capture_20220607T132930.gfxr, wb) failed (errno = 13)
```

Then you may need to set the “Files and Media” permission on the application.
That may be possible through the application’s settings in the Android
interface, or you can try “granting” the permission through the `pm` command:

```bash
adb shell pm grant ${Application Full Name} android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
```

**NOTE:** Replace `${Application Full Name}` with the full Android name of the
application being captured, for example "com.khronos.vulkan_samples" is the full
name of the Vulkan Samples.

Refer to the other settings in [Capture Options](#capture-options).


## Replaying API Calls

### Launch Script

The `gfxrecon.py` script, located in android/scripts directory of the
[gfxreconstruct git repository](https://github.com/LunarG/gfxreconstruct)
is provided as a convenient method for deploying and launching the Android replay tool. The script
currently supports the following commands:

Command | Description
--------|------------
install-apk | Install the specified APK file with the `-g -t -r` options.
replay | Launch the replay tool with the specified command line options.

### Install APK Command

The `gfxrecon.py install-apk` command has the following usage:

```text
usage: gfxrecon.py install-apk [-h] <file>

positional arguments:
  file        APK file to install

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

The command is equivalent to:

```bash
adb install -g -t -r <file>
```

The install-apk option of the `gfxrecon.py` script with the install-apk option is
is a convenient way to install the gfxrecon replay tool.

For example, starting at the root directory of the GFXReconstruct repo after
building, install the replay tool using the following commands:

```bash
pushd android
python scripts/gfxrecon.py install-apk tools/replay/build/outputs/apk/debug/replay-debug.apk
popd
```

#### Additional Permissions

A recent change to enable the replay tool on Android 12 and greater has resulted
in the need of enabling additional permissions on some versions of Android.
This was the result of updating the replay's Android Manifest file to add the
`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission flag.

##### Android 10

For replay devices running Android 10, the replay tool now requires the enabling
of legacy storage access:

```bash
adb shell appops set com.lunarg.gfxreconstruct.replay android:legacy_storage allow
```

##### Android 11 and Newer

For replay devices running Android 11 and newer, the replay tool requires that
the Android permission for `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` be granted either through
the following `adb` command or by clicking on the permission dialog when it
opens up:

```bash
adb shell appops set com.lunarg.gfxreconstruct.replay MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE allow
```

                        instance and device creation parameters (forwarded to
                        replay tool)
  -m MODE, --memory-translation MODE
                        Enable memory translation for replay on GPUs with
                        memory types that are not compatible with the capture
                        GPU's memory types. Available modes are: none, remap,
                        realign, rebind (forwarded to replay tool)
  --onhb, --omit-null-hardware-buffers
                        Omit Vulkan API calls which would pass a NULL
                        AHardwareBuffer*.  (forwarded to replay tool)
  --use-captured-swapchain-indices
                        Use the swapchain indices stored in the capture directly on the swapchain
                        setup for replay. The default without this option is to use a Virtual Swapchain
                        of images which match the swapchain in effect at capture time and which are
                        copied to the underlying swapchain of the implementation being replayed on.
  --no-retry-on-timeout By default, Vulkan api calls that have a timeout parameter
                        will retry the api call with a larger timeout value if the
                        expected return value is VK_SUCCESS but the initial call returned
                        VK_TIMEOUT. This argument disables the retry.
```

The command will force-stop an active replay process before starting the replay
activity with the following:

```bash
adb shell am force-stop com.lunarg.gfxreconstruct.replay
adb shell am start -n "com.lunarg.gfxreconstruct.replay/android.app.NativeActivity" \ 
                   -a android.intent.action.MAIN \ 
                   -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER \ 
                   --es "args" \ 
                   "<arg-list>"
```

If `gfxrecon-replay` was built with Vulkan Validation Layer support,
`VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` can be enabled and disabled in the same manner as
`VK_LAYER_LUNARG_gfxreconstruct`


#### Using the Replay Command

To replay a captured trace, find the location of the trace and replay it using
the built `gfxrecon-replay` tool:

```bash
./android/scripts/gfxrecon.py replay ${capture file path}
```

For example, if the capture was saved to the `/sdcard/Download` folder as
"gfxrecon_capture_20221210T120558.gfxr", the command would look like:

```bash
./android/scripts/gfxrecon.py replay /sdcard/Download/gfxrecon_capture_20221210T120558.gfxr
```

##### Pushing a Replay File from the Host

The Android GFXReconstruct replay script allows pushing a file from the host
to the Android device using the `-p` or `--push-file` option.

If a capture was pulled down onto the host, it could be pushed up to the Android
device using the following:

```bash
./android/scripts/gfxrecon.py replay --push-file ${HOST_FILE} ${RESULTING_ANDROID_FILE}
```

For example, if the capture file was found at
`/home/user/test/android_capture.gfxr` on the local host, and needed to be
pushed up to the Android device into the `/sdcard/Download` folder, then the
command would be:

```bash
./android/scripts/gfxrecon.py replay --push-file /home/user/test/android_capture.gfxr /sdcard/Download/android_capture.gfxr
```

This would result in the `gfxrecon.py` Python script first pushing up the file
to the requested location and then starting the replay.


### Touch Controls

The `gfxrecon-replay` tool for Android supports the following touch controls:

Key(s) | Action
-------|-------
Tap | Toggle pause/play.
Swipe left | Advance to the next frame when paused.

### Key Controls

The `gfxrecon-replay` tool for Android supports the following key controls. Key
events can be simulated through `adb` with the
`adb shell input keyevent <key-code>` command:

Key(s) | Key code(s) | Action
-------|-------------|-------
Space, p | Space = 62, p = 44 |Toggle pause/play.
D-pad right, n | D-pad right = 22, n = 42 | Advance to the next frame when paused.


### Limitations of Replay On Android

The current version of the Android replay layer has the following limitations:

  * Creation of more than one swapchain at a time is not guaranteed to work.
    The replay tool has a single `ANativeActivity` with a single
    `ANativeWindow`.
    Android may enforce a limitation of one Vulkan surface per-window.
     * **NOTE**:The `--surface-index` option may improve the chances of
       GFXReconstruct properly capturing the necessary content from the correct
       surface.
  * Permission to access external storage must be granted manually.

### Troubleshooting Replay of Applications

There are several steps to take to determine why a replay of a capture may not
be working.
Attempt each of these and re-run after the suggested modifications to see if
the problem is resolved.

#### Removing Unsupported Extensions

When capturing an application, the GFXReconstruct layer exposes the
`VK_EXT_tooling_info` extension.
If the application or OS uses this extension, it will be stored in the capture.
However, when replaying the capture, the extension may not be exposed by other
Vulkan components on that system and may fail in`vkCreateDevice` with
`VK_ERROR_EXTENSION_NOT_PRESENT`.
This is just one example of a scenario where an extension is present during
the capture process, but not during the replay later on.

To remedy this problem, use the `--remove-unsupported` argument to the
`gfxrecon.py replay` command.

For example (modifying the example above):

```bash
./android/scripts/gfxrecon.py replay --remove-unsupported /sdcard/Download/gfxrecon_capture_20221210T120558.gfxr
```

#### Virtual Swapchain

During replay, swapchain indices for present can be different from captured
indices.
Causes for this can include the swapchain image count differing between capture
and replay, and `vkAcquireNextImageKHR` returning a different `pImageIndex` at
replay to the one that was captured.
These issues can cause unexpected rendering or even crashes.

Virtual Swapchain insulates higher layers in the Vulkan stack from these
problems by creating a set of images, exactly matching the swapchain
configuration at capture time, which it exposes for them to render into.
Before a present, it copies the virtual image to a target swapchain image for
display.
Since this issue can happen in many situations, virtual swapchain is the default
setup.
If the user wants to bypass the feature and use the captured indices to present
directly on the swapchain of the replay implementation, they should add the
`--use-captured-swapchain-indices` option when invoking `gfxrecon-replay`.
