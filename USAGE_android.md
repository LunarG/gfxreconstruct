## Capturing API Calls

The GFXReconstruct capture layer is a Vulkan layer that intercepts Vulkan API
calls and logs them to a GFXReconstruct capture file.

### Before Use

#### Permissions

The GFXReconstruct layer can optionally read a configuration file
from or write capture files to external storage.  This requires that
the application loading the layer have external storage permissions.

The read and write external storage permission may be requested in
the application's manifest file.  When installing the application,
it may be necessary to ensure that the requested permissions are
granted through one of the following actions:

When installing the application with `adb install`:

* Specify the -g option: `adb install -g`

When deploying from Android Studio:

* Click on "Run" in the menu
* Choose "Edit Configurations..."
* In the dialog box, look for the "Install Flags:" text box
* Enter `-g`
* Click "Apply"

It may also be possible to grant external storage permissions to
an installed application through the device Settings.

**Failure to enable the write external storage permission** can cause
the layer to return `VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` from its
`vkCreateInstance` function if it fails to create a capture file.

#### Disabling Debug Breaks Triggered by the GFXReconstruct Layer

The Vulkan API allows Vulkan memory objects to be mapped by an application
for direct modification. To successfully capture an application,
the GFXReconstruct layer must be able to detect when the application
modifies the mapped memory. The layer can be configured to detect memory
modifications by marking the mapped memory as write protected, triggering
an access violation when the application writes to the memory. The
layer then uses a signal handler to intercept the signal generated by the
access violation, where it removes the write protection, marks the modified
memory page as dirty, and allows the application to continue.

When running an application in a debugger with the layer enabled, the
access violations triggered by the layer's memory tracking behavior may
cause the debugger to break. These debug breaks may be disabled for LLDB with
the following command:

```text
process handle SIGSEGV -n true -p true -s false
```

This command may be entered manually through the LLDB tab on Android Studio's
Debug panel.

It may also be set as a post attach command in the project configuration:

* Click on "Run" in the menu
* Choose "Edit Configurations..."
* In the dialog box, select the "Debugger" tab
* In the "Debugger" tab, select the "LLDB Post Attach Commands" tab
* Click the `+` to add the command to the command list
* Enter the `process handle SIGSEGV -n true -p true -s false` command
* Click "Apply"

### Enabling the Layer with ADB

The layer can be enabled through a system property by executing the following
ADB command:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.vulkan.layers 'VK_LAYER_LUNARG_gfxreconstruct'"
```

The following command will disable the layer:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.vulkan.layers ''"
```

### Capture Options

The GFXReconstruct layer supports the following options, which may be enabled
through Android system properties or a layer settings file.  Each Android
system property begins with the prefix `debug.gfxrecon`, and can be set
through ADB with the following command syntax:

```bash
adb shell "setprop <option> '<value>'"
```

For example, to set the log_level to "warning", specify:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.log_level 'warning'"
```

#### Supported Options

Options with the BOOL type accept the following values:

* A case-insensitive string value 'true' or a non-zero integer value indicate true.
* A case-insensitive string value 'false' or a zero integer value indicate false.

The capture layer will generate a warning message for unrecognized or invalid
option values.

Option | Property | Type | Description
------| ------------- |------|-------------
Capture File Name | debug.gfxrecon.capture_file | STRING | Path to use when creating the capture file.  Default is: `/sdcard/gfxrecon_capture.gfxr`
Capture Specific Frames | debug.gfxrecon.capture_frames | STRING | Specify one or more comma-separated frame ranges to capture.  Each range will be written to its own file.  A frame range can be specified as a single value, to specify a single frame to capture, or as two hyphenated values, to specify the first and last frame to capture.  Frame ranges should be specified in ascending order and cannot overlap. Note that frame numbering is 1-based (i.e. the first frame is frame 1).  Example: `200,301-305` will create two capture files, one containing a single frame and one containing five frames.  Default is: Empty string (all frames are captured).
Capture File Compression Type | debug.gfxrecon.capture_compression_type | STRING | Compression format to use with the capture file.  Valid values are: `LZ4`, `ZLIB`, `ZSTD`, and `NONE`. Default is: `LZ4`
Capture File Timestamp | debug.gfxrecon.capture_file_timestamp | BOOL | Add a timestamp to the capture file as described by [Timestamps](#timestamps).  Default is: `true`
Capture File Flush After Write | debug.gfxrecon.capture_file_flush | BOOL | Flush output stream after each packet is written to the capture file.  Default is: `false`
Log Level | debug.gfxrecon.log_level | STRING | Specify the highest level message to log.  Options are: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `fatal`.  The specified level and all levels listed after it will be enabled for logging.  For example, choosing the `warning` level will also enable the `error` and `fatal` levels. Default is: `info`
Log Output to Console | debug.gfxrecon.log_output_to_console | BOOL | Log messages will be written to Logcat. Default is: `true`
Log File | debug.gfxrecon.log_file | STRING | When set, log messages will be written to a file at the specified path. Default is: Empty string (file logging disabled).
Log Detailed | debug.gfxrecon.log_detailed | BOOL | Include name and line number from the file responsible for the log message. Default is: `false`
Log Allow Indents | debug.gfxrecon.log_allow_indents | BOOL | Apply additional indentation formatting to log messages. Default is: `false`
Log Break on Error | debug.gfxrecon.log_break_on_error | BOOL | Trigger a debug break when logging an error. Default is: `false`
Log File Create New | debug.gfxrecon.log_file_create_new | BOOL | Specifies that log file initialization should overwrite an existing file when true, or append to an existing file when false. Default is: `true`
Log File Flush After Write | debug.gfxrecon.log_file_flush_after_write | BOOL | Flush the log file to disk after each write when true. Default is: `false`
Log File Keep Open | debug.gfxrecon.log_file_keep_open | BOOL | Keep the log file open between log messages when true, or close and reopen the log file for each message when false. Default is: `true`
Memory Tracking Mode | debug.gfxrecon.memory_tracking_mode | STRING | Specifies the memory tracking mode to use for detecting modifications to mapped Vulkan memory objects. Available options are: `page_guard`, `assisted`, and `unassisted`. Default is `page_guard` <ul><li>`page_guard` tracks modifications to individual memory pages, which are written to the capture file on calls to `vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges`, `vkUnmapMemory`, and `vkQueueSubmit`. Tracking modifications requires allocating shadow memory for all mapped memory.</li><li>`assisted` expects the application to call `vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges` after memory is modified; the memory ranges specified to the `vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges` call will be written to the capture file during the call.</li><li>`unassisted` writes the full content of mapped memory to the capture file on calls to `vkUnmapMemory` and `vkQueueSubmit`. It is very inefficient and may be unusable with real-world applications that map large amounts of memory.</li></ul>
Page Guard Copy on Map | debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_copy_on_map | BOOL | When the `page_guard` memory tracking mode is enabled, copies the content of the mapped memory to the shadow memory immediately after the memory is mapped. Default is: `true`
Page Guard Separate Read Tracking | debug.gfxrecon.page_guard_separate_read | BOOL | When the `page_guard` memory tracking mode is enabled, copies the content of pages accessed for read from mapped memory to shadow memory on each read. Can overwrite unprocessed shadow memory content when an application is reading from and writing to the same page. Default is: `true`

#### Settings File

Capture options may also be specified through a layer settings file.  The layer
settings file will be loaded before the Android system properties are
processed, allowing system properties to override individual settings file
entries.

The `debug.gfxrecon.settings_path` Android system property is used to enable
a settings file:

```bash
adb shell "setprop debug.gfxrecon.settings_path /sdcard/vk_layer_settings.txt"
```

The system property may be set as either the path to the folder containing a
file named `vk_layer_settings.txt` or the full path to a file with a custom
name. When set to a folder, the capture layer will try to open a file in that
folder named `vk_layer_settings.txt`.  When set to a file, the capture layer
will try to open a file with the specified name.

The settings file may be combined with settings files for other layers. The
capture layer will ignore entries that do not start with the
'lunarg_gfxreconstruct.' prefix.

A sample layer settings file, documenting each available setting, can be found
in the GFXReconstruct GitHub repository at `layer/vk_layer_settings.txt`. Most
binary distributions of the GFXReconstruct software will also include a sample
settings file.

### Capture Files

Capture files are created on the first call to `vkCreateInstance`, when the
Vulkan loader loads the capture layer, and are closed on `vkDestroyInstance`,
when the last active instance is destroyed and the layer is unloaded.

If multiple instances are active concurrently, only one capture file will be
created. If multiple instances are active consecutively (i.e. an instance is
created and destroyed before the next instance is created), the creation of
each instance will generate a new file. For applications that create multiple
instances consecutively, it will be necessary to enable capture file timestamps
to prevent each new instance from overwriting the file created by the previous
instance.

If the layer fails to open the capture file, it will make the call to
`vkCreateInstance` fail, returning `VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED`.

#### Specifying Capture File Location

The capture file's save location can be specified by setting the
`debug.gfxrecon.capture_file` system property, described above in
the [Layer Options](#layer-options) section.

#### Timestamps

When capture file timestamps are enabled, a timestamp with an
[ISO 8601-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
format will be added to the name of every file created by the layer. The
timestamp is generated when the capture file is created by the layer's
`vkCreateInstance` function and is added to the base filename specified
through the `debug.gfxrecon.capture_file` system property. Timestamps have
the form:

```text
_yyyymmddThhmmss
```

where the lower-case letters stand for: Year, Month, Day, Hours, Minutes,
Seconds.  The `T` is a designator that separates the date and time components.
Time is reported for the local timezone and is specified with the 24-hour
format.

The following example shows a timestamp that was added to a file that was
originally named `gfxrecon_capture.gfxr` and was created at 2:35 PM
on November 25, 2018:
  `gfxrecon_capture_20181125T143527.gfxr`

## Replaying API Calls

### Launch Script

The `gfxrecon.py` script, located in android/scripts directory of the
[gfxreconstruct git repository](https://github.com/LunarG/gfxreconstruct)
is provided as a convenient method for deploying and launching the Android replay tool. The script
currently supports the following commands:

Command | Description
--------|------------
install-apk | Install the specified APK file with the `-g -t -r` options.
replay | Launch the replay tool with the specified command line options.

### Install APK Command

The `gfxrecon.py install-apk` command has the following usage:

```text
usage: gfxrecon.py install-apk [-h] <file>

positional arguments:
  file        APK file to install

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

The command is equivalent to:

```bash
adb install -g -t -r <file>
```

The install-apk option of the `gfxrecon.py` script with the install-apk option is
is a convenient way to install the gfxrecon replay tool. For example:

```bash
python gfxrecon.py install replay-debug.apk
```

### Replay Command

The `gfxrecon.py replay` command has the following usage:

```text
usage: gfxrecon.py replay [-h] [-p local-file] [--version] [--pause-frame N]
                          [--paused] [--sfa] [--opcd] [-m <mode>]
                          [file]

positional arguments:
  file                  File on device to play (forwarded to replay tool)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p local-file, --push-file local-file
                        Local file to push to the location on device specified
                        by <file>
  --version             Print version information and exit (forwarded to
                        replay tool)
  --pause-frame N       Pause after replaying frame number N (forwarded to
                        replay tool)
  --paused              Pause after replaying the first frame (same as "--
                        pause-frame 1"; forwarded to replay tool)
  --sfa, --skip-failed-allocations
                        Skip vkAllocateMemory, vkAllocateCommandBuffers, and
                        vkAllocateDescriptorSets calls that failed during
                        capture (forwarded to replay tool)
  --opcd, --omit-pipeline-cache-data
                        Omit pipeline cache data from calls to
                        vkCreatePipelineCache (forwarded to replay tool)
  -m <mode>, --memory-translation <mode>
                        Enable memory translation for replay on GPUs with
                        memory types that are not compatible with the capture
                        GPU's memory types. Available modes are: none, remap,
                        realign, rebind (forwarded to replay tool)
```

The command will force-stop an active replay process before starting the replay
activity with the following:

```bash
adb shell am force-stop com.lunarg.gfxreconstruct.replay
adb shell am start -n "com.lunarg.gfxreconstruct.replay/android.app.NativeActivity" -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER --es "args" "<arg-list>"
```
