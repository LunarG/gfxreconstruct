# GFXReconstruct Replay Tool

The GFXReconstruct Replay tool (`gfxrecon-replay`) can be used to replay
files captured or generated by other GFXReconstruct components.

By default, the `gfxrecon-replay` application will look for a file called
`gfxrecon_capture.gfxr` and play that back.
However, the user can also choose to pass in the name of a specific
capture file to replay.


## Running a Different Capture File

### Desktop

On the desktop, to replay a capture file, you can simply append
the capture file name as an argument to the replay command:

```
gfxrecon-replay <capture_file_with_path>
```

### Android

**NOTE:** Make sure the GFXReconstruct Vulkan Layer is disabled prior to running.
Also, ensure that the application has permissions to access the device
storage.

To run, simply click the icon.  The replay tool will look for a file
called `gfxrecon_capture.gfxr` in the top-level `/sdcard` folder.
If it finds that file, it will perform the replay.

You may provide arguments to the replay application using `am start` in
the following way:

```
--es "args" "<arg1> <arg2> ... <argn>"
```

For example, if you wanted to use a different capture file, you would
pass in only a single argument with the location and name of the
capture file.

#### Current Issues

1. Exiting the replay application then re-opening the Android Activity
   that just completed does not work.  It will just draw a black screen.
